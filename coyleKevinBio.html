    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <img src="images/bwHeadShot.jpeg" width="400">
        <p>“Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't.” - Bill Nye</p>
        <p>Every bit of knowledge no matter how big or small sheds a little more light 
            on the darkness of the unknown. In my work I
            strive to find ways of organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data that 
            provide individuals with the clearest view of the answers that are often 
            obscured by the mess often found in real life data. The interdisciplinary skill 
            set and approach to problem solving that has served me well throughout my career
            and education provides a unique vantage point for handling complex data and 
            multi-faceted problems. The proactive, preventative approach I first witnessed 
            in my clinical experiences in medicine inspires me to use my technical abilities
            in data science and epidemiology to assit in identifying key drivers that impact 
            the etiology and pathogenesis of disease.
        </p>
        <p>Interdisciplinary research is my passion. I love to work with people from 
            diverse cultural and educational backgrounds that bring unique perspectives 
            to projects. I value confidence, transparency, integrity, and kindness as 
            I believe these are the attributes that enable people to come together 
            and build great solutions. My backgroud is diverse, with professional experinces 
            in clinical trial research, machine learning, and clinical medicine. I have 
            extensive experince working as statisticain counsulting on several clinical 
            trial grade research projects and building/tuning ML models. 
        </p>
